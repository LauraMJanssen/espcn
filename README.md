# ESPCN

ESPCN = *Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network* for IVUS Images

Based on the repository by [Joao da Mata](https://github.com/jlfilho/ESPCN-Keras)

## Training
- by executing 'train.py'
- Code: 
	**python train.py**
- add other arguments if required


## Execution
- upload ESPCN.ipynb file to Google Colaboratory
- follow instructions
- execute elements in the order they are included


## File Structure
- **ESPCN.ipynb**: Google Colaboratory execution file
- **train.py**: training functions 
- **model**: implementation of the ESPCN model
- **libs** some additional function 
- **SRImages**: some example images generated with the ESPCN models and LR input images
- **trainedModels**: fully trained models ('bare' & TL)
